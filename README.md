Purpose:
A webpage designed to help people who are working to recover from Aphasia.
This program does not use any words as we need to focus on the images to keep things straight forward.

Changes to add:
1. Dynamic to different screen sizes
2. Clean up the webpage GUI
3. Clean up the code / comments / file structure

How someone with Asphasia would use the webpage:
1. Try to identify the image and say it out loud eg. "Apple"
2. Click on the "talking head" to hear the answer
3. Click the "left button" to move to the next image
4. Click the "right button" to move to the previous image
5. Repeat the exercise often and see if you can improve each day
6. You got this!
